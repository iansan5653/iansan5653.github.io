  <h1>Ian Sanders</h1>

  <p>Hello, I'm an engineer and a sailor in Washington, DC. I currently work at GitHub and own a nearly 40-year old Caliber 28 sailboat named <i>Endeavour</i>. This is my personal site I keep around for my own enjoyment; it's intentionally low-fidelity in an attempt to eliminate my excuses not to write. My work here may not be polished or useful, but I hope you at least find it interesting.</p>

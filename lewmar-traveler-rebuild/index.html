        <p>
          <i>Endeavour</i>, my 1988 Caliber 28, is equipped with an original
          Lewmar Solent mid-boom mainsheet system with a cabintop traveler. This
          is a great setup for a cruiser &mdash; it allows for a huge range of
          mainsheet trim positions while keeping the cockpit completely free.
          However, this setup creates especially high loads on the traveler, so
          it must be robust and well-maintained.
        </p>

        <p>
          However, when I first purchased the vessel, her traveler was in very
          rough shape. It could only be adjusted when completely unloaded, an
          unacceptable state for such a critical component. The blocks didn't
          spin, the control lines were stiff and worn, and most importantly, the
          roller bearings didn't roll at all.
        </p>

        <p>
          New traveler systems are sexy and tempting, but they also cost several
          thousand dollars. Even just replacing the car wasn't an option in this
          case because Lewmar doesn't make any cars that are compatible with the
          old Solent tracks, and my extensive eBay searching failed to turn up a
          single promising result.
        </p>

        <p>
          So I was very motivated to find a way to bring this gear back to life.
          Thankfully, with some creativity and effort, I was able to do so. Fair
          warning: this will be a long article, somewhere in between a tutorial
          and a narrative about the engineering and design process. I hope you
          find it interesting enough to stick with me.
        </p>

        <h2>Disassembly</h2>

        <p>
          For instructions on disassembling this traveler system as well as an
          overview of how it works, please read this excellent
          <a

          article from <i>Foghorn Lullaby</i>.
        </p>

        <p>
          There is only one caution I would add to this article for those
          attempting this themselves: be careful not to allow the wheels or pins
          to drop overboard when removing the car from the track! The track is
          what holds them into the car; when the car is removed, they are free
          to fall out. If you have access to a 3D printer, I have designed a
          3D-printable piece of track section which can be used use to contain
          the wheels.
        </p>

        <h2>Rebuilding the car</h2>

        <p>
          The car runs on 8 wheels, which roll alongside the bottom side of the
          top edge of the track when the car is loaded. These wheels are ball
          bearings in plastic housings, and are held in place by steel axle
          pins. These pins are only held in place by the track itself.
        </p>

        <figure>
          <img
            src="./original-wheel-axle.jpg"
            alt="Close-up of a plastic wheel on a metal axle; wheel shows significant wear."
          />

          <figcaption>One of the eight wheels and its axle.</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
          Careful examination of the car and track showed several significant
          issues. First, the plastic bearing housings had become brittle and
          worn down over time. A few of the bearings had failed completely.
        </p>

        <figure>
          <img
            src="./failed-bearing-pieces.jpg"
            alt="Pieces of a failed bearing including a broken plastic housing and several metal balls."
            loading="lazy"
          />

          <figcaption>
            This bearing crumbled when I removed it from the axle.
          </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
          The second issue was a design flaw from the manufacturer: because the
          pins are only held in place by the track, they can shift inwards
          slightly. This allows them to rub against the track, causing wear. It
          also reduces the amount of material holding them in place, allowing
          them to shift slightly and loading them at an angle.
        </p>

            src="./sketch-pin-misalignment.jpg"

          />

          <figcaption>

          </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
          My first attempt at a solution was to replace the bearings with new
          off-the-shelf components. Their dimensions are very similar to
          standard 608 bearings, and I even managed to find and purchase some of
          these in marine-grade 316 stainless steel. However, when I received
          the bearings I decided that the dimensions weren't close enough (they
          were too narrow) and, more importantly, I didn't want to have steel
          wheels wearing on my aluminum track.
        </p>

        <p>
          Returning to the drawing board, my only option was to create new
          bearings. In the interest of strength, durability, and simplicity, I
          decided to move from ball bearings to plain bearings. Custom plain
          bearings could be manufactured relatively easily, and careful material
          selection would still minimize friction. In fact, under very high
          loads, plain bearings typically perform better than ball bearings
          anyway.
        </p>

        <p>
          The bearings need to have a 1" outer diameter, 5/16" inner diameter,
          and be 1/2" wide. For the wheel I selected Delrin plastic as a durable
          but easily machinable wheel material. McMaster-Carr sells a 1"
          cylinder of black Delrin as
          <a href="https://www.mcmaster.com/catalog/132/4139/8576K21"
            >part #8576K21</a
          >. I probably could have had the Delrin bear directly on the shaft
          without much issue, but I wanted to minimize friction as much as
          possible. So I designed my wheels with an oil-impregnated sleeve
          bearing that actually runs on the shaft (McMaster-Carr
          <a href="https://www.mcmaster.com/products/2868t55/">#2868T55</a>).
        </p>

        <p>
          With these parts acquired, all I had to do was hire a local machine
          shop to cut the bar into 10 (8 plus 2 spares) 1/2" discs, cut a 3/8"
          hole in the center, and press-fit the bearing sleeves.
        </p>

        </figure>

        <p>
          The new wheels were perfect, however they alone could't solve the
          design flaw that allowed the pins to wear on the traveler and become
          crooked. I thought I might be able to get away without resolving that
          issue, but after trying it out I realized there was no way around it
          &mdash; I had to re-engineer the whole assembly.
        </p>

        <p>
          At this point it struck me that the whole issue would be solved if the
          pins just faced the other way. If the heads of the pins were on the
          exterior of the car, they wouldn't be able to rub against the track.
          And they would fit all the way through the car, so they couldn't be
          pulled out of alignment.
        </p>

            src="./sketch-pin-reversed.jpg"
            alt="Cutaway sketch of reversed pins in housing; head of pins is now on exterior of car and so they cannot scrape against the track, and the full length of the pin is supported to prevent them from becoming crooked."

          <figcaption>
            How reversing the pins would solve the problems.
          </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
          However, I couldn't just reverse the pins. In that direction, there
          would be nothing stopping them from just falling out &mdash; I needed
          to retain them somehow.
        </p>

        <p>
          To hold the pins in place, I designed and 3D printed a simple retainer
          from PETG plastic. This can be low-profile and lightweight because it
          doesn't need to support much load; it just stops the pins from falling
          out of place. The retainer is held onto the car by two small 4-40
          machine screws, installed in holes I drilled and tapped at home.
        </p>

          />

        </figure>

        <p>
          With the wheel bearing and pin issues finally resolved, the car
          <em>almost</em> rolled perfectly on the track. However, I still
          noticed some extra friction caused by the wheels rubbing against the
          inside wall of the car. So I also printed some simple washers from
          PETG to act as bearings between the wheels and car body.
        </p>

          <img
            src="./washer-bearings.jpg"
            alt="Image highlighting printed washer bearing installations: One axle is visible without a wheel, showing how the washer sits against the interior side of the car. The other wheels are present, showing how the washer creates a narrow gap between the wheels and interior of the car."

          />

          <figcaption>

          </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
          Finally, the car is rolling like a dream, even under extremely high
          loads. And I am confident it is bulletproof.
        </p>

        <h2>Improving control lines</h2>

        <p>
          With the car running smoothly, the only remaining issue was the
          control lines. Replacing the line was easy (I used 10mm New England
          Ropes Sta-Set), but the plastic sheaves were brittle and ran poorly
          after sitting in the sun for several decades.
        </p>

        <p>
          I wanted to upgrade the sheaved to ball bearings. I figured since I
          had changed out the wheels for plain bearings, upgrading the rope
          sheaves to ball bearings would offset any increase in friction. And I
          just always prefer ball bearing blocks onboard.
        </p>

        <p>
          All the major gear manufacturers offer a line of housingless ball
          bearing sheaves, so upgrading was just a matter of finding sheaves
          that fit. After extensive research I was able to track down suitable
          replacements: Lewmar Size 2 ball bearing sheaves come in a pack of
          four, which is great for the two traveler car sheaves and the small
          end block sheaves. Vela Sailing Supply sells them under
          <a
            href="https://velasailingsupply.com/products/lewmar-size-2-ball-bearing-sheave-pack-of-4"
            >part #LEW29472970BK</a
          >.
        </p>

          <figcaption>Reassembled car with new sheaves and line.</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
          <strong>Note:</strong> When reassembling the car, it's critically
          important to grease the threads of all the stainless screws with
          Tef-Gel or similar to prevent siezing.
        </p>

        <p>
          The 1/4" inner diameter is perfect for the car but slightly too large
          for the 3/16" screws that hold the end stops together. However that
          hasn't been a problem for me.
        </p>

        <p>
          For the large sheaves on the end blocks, Harken's 57mm Delrin sheave
          is almost perfect. The only problem is that it's just slightly
          narrower than the Lewmar sheave. The extra space can be easily shimmed
          with a standard washer.
        </p>

            the housing.

        <p>
          I also disassembled, cleaned up, and oiled the cam cleats, but I
          haven't replaced them as they still work great. If I ever do decide to
          replace them, I think any standard camcleat such as the ones Ronstan
          sells would fit perfectly.

          I completed this project more than two years ago (which sure sounds
          better than "I procrastinated on writing this article for two years")
          and the new traveler has been absolutely perfect ever since! I've
          sailed in heavy weather, survived one or two crash gybes, and put
          about 1,500 nm on the boat since then, and I am pleased to report not
          a single further problem with it.
